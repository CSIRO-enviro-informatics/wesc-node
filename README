WESC Data Node deployment

This repository provides a standardised method for deploying a Spatial Information Services Stack (SISS) configured
for WESCML (http://wescml.org) for SF-0.

Pre-requisite:
* csiro_env/geoserver - clone and build from  https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/docker-geoserver/


Run:
./run.sh

In a browser try:
 https://localhost:8110/geoserver


Advanced

If you need to co-ordinate multiple wesc node deployments, this repo has text files to specify the details.

dataselection.txt
- This file takes tab-separated parameters (<name> <etl-config id> <exposed port number>)  each row and deploy a node
- To add a new node, simply add a new row with details to the ETL files and port numbers
- Example: 
sydney-ex       combinedmeterreadings-sydneywater-lga   8110


dataimportcfg.txt
- This file contains the etl-config details for each deployment and contains details for 4 fields:
  1) etl-config id. This is used to map a node with the spcific wesc element - combinedmeterreadings, watersupply or electricitysupply
  2) name. Description for the etl-config
  3) etlgenerate. This points to relative path to the directory containing the etl script
  3) etlscript. This points to relative path to the SQL etl script as output.
- Example:
    {
        "id": "combinedmeterreadings-sydneywater-lga",
        "name": "Example Sydney Consumption Data for water",
        "etlgenerate": "example/example-sydney-lga-etl.py",
        "etlscript": "combinedmeterreadings-sydney-lga.sql"
    },
